# pokemon_tcg_card_functions

Python scripts meant to help sort your collection and your sealed products. The first two scripts help keep track of your cards/products with the primary focus on helping keep track of pricing via PriceCharting.com. The third script is to help make a national dex binder. It also tells you what position on a 3x3 page your card should go and on what page specifically. 


In the `scripts_and_files` directory, we find all the scripts and files needed. Note there is a csv file containing the dex numbers of all Pokémon (up to date on Gen 9).

In the 'recipes' directory, you'll find two recipes. The first, `1_pokemon_cards_products`, is for keeping track of your cards/products along with pricing via PriceCharting. The second recipe, `2_pokemon_dex_sorting`, is to sort your Pokémon cards to make a National Dex binder.

These pipelines have been tested on `python 3.8` and `3.9` with no adverse effects.

## Getting started 

* You can check out the `example_notebooks` section to see how the scripts work and download them as templates for your own collection. Have fun!
